> Guesstimated prices for when a receipt is missing.  Usually milk gallons, tomato, lettuce, celery, etc.
> Calculation bug in price-per-unit.  Search "clod" and compare 12/7($119.98) and 12/28($59.94).
  > Might not be a bug as the invoice should've had delivered_quantity=2 for 12/7 which makes the numbers work.
> Missed invoice 2022-08-11-sysco-485406667.jpg
> String cheese pack/unit quantity missing.  Filled in 160 based on others but doesn't look right.  cryptic_name like '%cheese%string%' and delivered_date > current_date - '12 months'::interval
> Market:Order - redo quantity such that a $/dz is specified and an arbitrary quantity entered.  Orders 27 and $5.50/dz = $12.375

> Add recipe with linked ingredients.
  > Need placeholder ingredients for ones which do not yet exist.
  > Price the ingredients for the quantity used.
    > Need conversions like in the average measure report from the site combined with the "Latest Pricing" sheet
    > Would it be helpful to have the price of an order?  As in, full package price for if none of the ingredient is on hand?
