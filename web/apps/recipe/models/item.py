# Item - Ketchup, salt, chicken thigh - not tied to a recipe.  Just a level of separation between items needed for
# recipes and items we have in inventory.  As in, when adding a new recipe that uses an item we've never ordered, an
# Item object acts as the in-between.  When we do end up ordering something that matches, the Item can be updated.
